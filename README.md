# IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON EDUCATION IN KENYA
COVID-19 pandemic really affected the education specifically in Kenya. It caused alot of anxiety and emotional stress as the students are forced to learn everything in a very short time.
2020 academic year was lost and all the syllabus coverage pushed to 2021, the anxiety at the end of the year was so bad that students started to riot and burn schools.
